## Introduction

MQTT is a lightweight messaging protocol widely used in IoT (Internet of Things) to enable communication between devices. This project showcases how to set up an Arduino to publish and subscribe to MQTT topics, allowing it to interact with other devices or cloud services.

## Features

- **MQTT Integration:** Publish and subscribe to MQTT topics using Arduino.
- **IoT Ready:** Designed for IoT applications requiring low bandwidth and reliable communication.
- **Easy Setup:** Simple code and instructions for getting started with MQTT on Arduino.

## Hardware Requirements

- **Arduino Board:** Any Arduino-compatible board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Nano, or ESP8266/ESP32).
- **WiFi Module:** ESP8266 or ESP32 (if using a board without built-in WiFi).
- **MQTT Broker:** You can use a local broker like Mosquitto or a cloud-based broker like HiveMQ.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/White-Vulpes/ArduinoMineMQTT.git
   ```

2. **Install the required libraries:**

   Open the Arduino IDE, go to **Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries**, and install the following libraries:
   - `PubSubClient` for MQTT communication
   - `ESP8266WiFi` or `WiFi` library for WiFi connectivity (depending on your board)

3. **Open the project in Arduino IDE:**

   Navigate to the project directory and open the `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.

4. **Configure your MQTT broker:**

   Update the code with your MQTT broker's IP address, port, and any necessary credentials.

5. **Upload the code to your Arduino:**

   Connect your Arduino board to your computer and upload the code.

## Usage

- **Publishing Messages:**
  
  The Arduino can publish data (e.g., sensor readings) to a specific MQTT topic. Modify the `publish` function in the code to send your data to the desired topic.

- **Subscribing to Topics:**
  
  The Arduino can also subscribe to MQTT topics to receive commands or data. Modify the `subscribe` function to handle incoming messages from the specified topic.

- **Monitoring:**
  
  Use an MQTT client (e.g., MQTT.fx or a mobile app) to monitor the messages being published and subscribed to by your Arduino.

## Contributing
